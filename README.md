<p>This is the web Application I built with Laravel and Jquery while I was being interned in Active IT Zone. Using this application user can login, signup and create their CVs. Users will be able to download it as a pdf for which I used a 3rd party package. They can publish their CVs or save it as draft. The application also includes a realtime bidding app which uses jquery that makes a network call after a certain period of time defined by the developer.</p>
